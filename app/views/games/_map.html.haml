-# Open AI's ChatGPT o1, 4o, and 4o-mini models were used from November
-# 4th 2024 to December 15, 2024. The AI Generated code was not
-# sufficient or functional outright nor was it copied at face value.
-# Using our knowledge of software engineering, ruby, rails, web
-# development, and the constraints of our customer, SELT Team 007
-# (Cody Alison, Yusuf Halim, Ziad Hasabrabu, Bradley Johnson,
-# and Sheng Wang) used GAITs responsibly; verifying that each line made
-# sense in the context of the app, conformed to the overall design,
-# and was testable. We maintained a strict peer review process before
-# any code changes were merged into the development or production
-# branches. All code was tested with BDD and TDD tests as well as
-# empirically tested with local run servers and Heroku deployments to
-# ensure compatibility.
